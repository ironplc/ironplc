# Homebrew Formula for installing IronPLC Compiler on macOS or Linux.
#
# This file may be in one of two forms:

# * the filled in template
#
# The template form has the following variables:
# * VERSION - the bare version number, such as 1.2.3
# * MACFILENAME - the name of the TAR.GZ file containing ironplcc, such as ironplcc-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
# * MACSHA256 - the SHA256 of {MACFILENAME}
# * LINUXFILENAME - the name of the TAR.GZ file containing ironplcc, such as ironplcc-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz
# * LINUXSHA256 - the SHA256 of {LINUXFILENAME}
# 
# The formula assumes releases are from the GitHub ironplc/ironplc repository
# and that releases are prefixed with "v".
