# Homebrew Formula for installing IronPLC Compiler on macOS or Linux.
#
# This file may be in one of two forms:
# * a template with variables that can be filled in at build time
# * the filled in template
#
# The template form has the following variables:
# * VERSION - the bare version number, such as 1.2.3
# * MACFILENAME - the name of the TAR.GZ file containing ironplcc, such as ironplcc-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
# * MACSHA256 - the SHA256 of {MACFILENAME}
# * LINUXFILENAME - the name of the TAR.GZ file containing ironplcc, such as ironplcc-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz
# * LINUXSHA256 - the SHA256 of {LINUXFILENAME}
# 
# The formula assumes releases are from the GitHub ironplc/ironplc repository
# and that releases are prefixed with "v".

      # Keep the binaries and their runtime resources together in libexec, then
      # symlink the executables onto the PATH. The compiler reads its bundled
      # compatibility libraries from <exedir>/resources/libs at runtime, and
      # current_exe() resolves the bin symlink back to libexec -- so the
      # libraries must sit beside the real binaries here, not in bin.
