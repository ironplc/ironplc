# IEC 61131-3 Compliance Guidelines

See [specs/steering/iec-61131-3-compliance.md](../../specs/steering/iec-61131-3-compliance.md) for the full IEC 61131-3 compliance guidance.

This guidance applies when working with semantic analysis and language feature implementation, particularly files in `**/analyzer/**` directories.
