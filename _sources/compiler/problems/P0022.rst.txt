.. problem-summary:: P0022

This error occurs when a type is referenced that has not been declared.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P0022:

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK Example
   VAR
       MyVar : UndeclaredType;  (* Error: UndeclaredType is not declared *)
   END_VAR
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

The variable ``MyVar`` uses the type ``UndeclaredType`` which has not been declared anywhere in the program.

To fix this error, declare the type before using it:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       MyType : INT;
   END_TYPE

   FUNCTION_BLOCK Example
   VAR
       MyVar : MyType;  (* Correct: MyType is now declared *)
   END_VAR
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
