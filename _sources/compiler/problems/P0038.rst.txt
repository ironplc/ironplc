.. problem-summary:: P0038

This error occurs when a type alias references a parent type that has not been declared.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P0038:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       MyAlias : UndeclaredParentType;  (* Error: UndeclaredParentType is not declared *)
   END_TYPE

The type alias ``MyAlias`` references ``UndeclaredParentType`` which has not been declared.

To fix this error, declare the parent type before creating the alias:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       BaseType : INT;
       MyAlias : BaseType;  (* Correct: BaseType is now declared *)
   END_TYPE
