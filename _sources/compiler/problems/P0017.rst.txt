.. problem-summary:: P0017

This error occurs when a function block instance is declared with the ``CONSTANT`` qualifier, which is not permitted.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P0017:

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK Callee
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
   
   FUNCTION_BLOCK Caller
   VAR CONSTANT
       FB_INSTANCE : Callee;  (* Error: CONSTANT qualifier not permitted for function block *)
   END_VAR
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

Function block instances cannot be declared as constants because they represent instances of executable code, not constant values.

To fix this error, remove the ``CONSTANT`` qualifier from the function block instance declaration:

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK Callee
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
   
   FUNCTION_BLOCK Caller
   VAR
       FB_INSTANCE : Callee;  (* Correct: No CONSTANT qualifier *)
   END_VAR
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
