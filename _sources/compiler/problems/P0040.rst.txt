.. problem-summary:: P0040

This error occurs when an array declaration references an element type that has not been declared.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P0040:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       DataArray : ARRAY[1..10] OF UndeclaredElementType;  (* Error: Element type not declared *)
   END_TYPE

The array ``DataArray`` references ``UndeclaredElementType`` as its element type, but this type has not been declared.

To fix this error, declare the element type first:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       ElementType : INT;
       DataArray : ARRAY[1..10] OF ElementType;  (* Correct: Element type declared *)
   END_TYPE

Alternatively, use a built-in type:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       DataArray : ARRAY[1..10] OF INT;  (* Correct: INT is a built-in type *)
   END_TYPE
