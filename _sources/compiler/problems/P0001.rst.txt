.. problem-summary:: P0001

This error occurs when a comment is not properly closed before the end of the file.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P0001:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
   (* A comment that is never closed
       CustomStruct : STRUCT 
           Name: BOOL;
       END_STRUCT;
   END_TYPE

The comment starting with ``(*`` is never closed with ``*)``, causing the parser to reach the end of file while still inside the comment.

To fix this error, properly close the comment:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
   (* A comment that is properly closed *)
       CustomStruct : STRUCT 
           Name: BOOL;
       END_STRUCT;
   END_TYPE
