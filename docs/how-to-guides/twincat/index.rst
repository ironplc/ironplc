====================
Coming from TwinCAT
====================

These guides are for engineers who already use Beckhoff TwinCAT 3 and want
to use IronPLC alongside it.

IronPLC can read TwinCAT project files (:file:`.plcproj`, :file:`.TcPOU`,
:file:`.TcGVL`) directly, so you can get a second opinion on your code
without changing your workflow.
