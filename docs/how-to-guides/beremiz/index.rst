Coming from Beremiz
====================

These guides are for engineers who already use `Beremiz
<https://beremiz.org/>`_ and want to use IronPLC alongside it.

IronPLC can read Beremiz project files (:file:`plc.xml`) directly, so you
can get a second opinion on your code without changing your workflow.
