Quick start tutorial
====================

This tutorial guides you from installation to a working IEC 61131-3
application, introducing one concept at a time. Each chapter builds on the
last and leaves you with a program you can check for correctness.

If you are completely new to PLC programming, you may want to read
:doc:`/explanation/what-is-iec-61131-3` first for background on the
concepts.
