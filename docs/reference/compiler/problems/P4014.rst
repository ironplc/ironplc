.. problem-summary:: P4014

This error occurs when a symbol (variable, constant, or other identifier) is declared more than once in the same scope.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P4014:

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK Example
   VAR
       DuplicateName : INT;
       DuplicateName : BOOL;  (* Error: Symbol name duplicated *)
   END_VAR
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

The symbol ``DuplicateName`` is declared twice in the same variable section, which is not allowed.

To fix this error, ensure all symbol names are unique within their scope:

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK Example
   VAR
       FirstVariable : INT;
       SecondVariable : BOOL;  (* Correct: Different name *)
   END_VAR
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
