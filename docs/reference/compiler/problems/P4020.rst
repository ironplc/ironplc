.. problem-summary:: P4020

This error occurs when the compiler cannot find a PROGRAM declaration in the source. At least one PROGRAM is required to compile and run.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P4020:

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK my_fb
   VAR
       x : INT;
   END_VAR
       x := 1;
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

The source defines a function block but does not contain a PROGRAM declaration, so the compiler has no entry point.

To fix this error, add a PROGRAM declaration:

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK my_fb
   VAR
       x : INT;
   END_VAR
       x := 1;
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

   PROGRAM main
   VAR
       fb_inst : my_fb;
   END_VAR
       fb_inst();
   END_PROGRAM
