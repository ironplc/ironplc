.. problem-summary:: P4008

This error occurs when a variable is declared as constant but does not define an initial value.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P4008:

.. code-block::

   VAR_GLOBAL CONSTANT
       ResetCounterValue : INT;  (* Error: CONSTANT variable must have initializer *)
   END_VAR

The variable ``ResetCounterValue`` is declared as ``CONSTANT`` but does not have an initial value assigned.

To fix this error, provide an initial value for the constant variable:

.. code-block::

   VAR_GLOBAL CONSTANT
       ResetCounterValue : INT := 17;  (* Correct: CONSTANT variable has initializer *)
   END_VAR
