.. problem-summary:: P9003

This error occurs when a PLCopen XML file contains a POU (Program Organization Unit) with a body language that is not yet supported by the compiler.

Example
-------

The following XML uses Ladder Diagram (LD), which is not supported:

.. code-block:: xml

   <pou name="MyProgram" pouType="program">
     <body>
       <LD>
         <!-- Ladder Diagram content -->
       </LD>
     </body>
   </pou>

Supported Languages
-------------------

The compiler currently supports:

- **ST (Structured Text)** - Fully supported
- **SFC (Sequential Function Chart)** - Supported with ST action bodies

Not Yet Supported
-----------------

The following languages are defined in IEC 61131-3 but not yet implemented:

- **FBD (Function Block Diagram)** - Graphical language
- **LD (Ladder Diagram)** - Graphical language
- **IL (Instruction List)** - Deprecated in IEC 61131-3 3rd edition

To fix this error, convert the POU body to Structured Text (ST) or use a different tool that supports the graphical languages.
