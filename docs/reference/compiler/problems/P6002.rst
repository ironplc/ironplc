.. problem-summary:: P6002

This error occurs when the compiler is unable to read metadata for a file or directory, typically due to permission issues, filesystem corruption, or the file being in an inaccessible state.

Example
-------

This error typically occurs when:

1. The file exists but its metadata cannot be read due to permission restrictions
2. The filesystem is corrupted or experiencing issues
3. The file is locked by another process
4. There are hardware issues with the storage device

To fix this error, ensure that:

- You have appropriate permissions to read the file metadata
- The filesystem is functioning correctly
- The file is not locked by another process
- The storage device is working properly

.. code-block:: bash

   # Example scenarios that might cause this error:
   ironplcc check "/proc/restricted/file.st"      # System file with restricted access
   ironplcc check "/mnt/corrupted/file.st"        # File on corrupted filesystem
