.. problem-summary:: P0005

This error occurs when an element appears in a context where it is not permitted according to the current compiler state or parsing context.

Example
-------

This error typically occurs when language elements are used in inappropriate contexts, such as:

1. Using statements outside of executable sections
2. Declaring variables in inappropriate sections
3. Using keywords in wrong contexts

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       DataStruct : STRUCT
           Field1 : BOOL;
           SomeVariable := SomeVariable + 1;  (* Error: Statement not allowed in struct *)
       END_STRUCT;
   END_TYPE

The assignment statement ``SomeVariable := SomeVariable + 1`` is not permitted inside a structure declaration.

To fix this error, ensure elements are used in their appropriate contexts:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       DataStruct : STRUCT
           Field1 : BOOL;
           Field2 : INT;  (* Correct: Only declarations in struct *)
       END_STRUCT;
   END_TYPE
