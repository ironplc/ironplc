.. problem-summary:: P2023

Array size calculation resulted in overflow. This occurs when the total number of elements in an array exceeds the maximum supported size.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P2023:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       HUGE_ARRAY : ARRAY [1..100000, 1..100000] OF INT;
   END_TYPE

This error occurs because the total array size (100,000 × 100,000 = 10,000,000,000 elements) exceeds the maximum supported array size.

To fix this error, reduce the array dimensions to a reasonable size:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       REASONABLE_ARRAY : ARRAY [1..1000, 1..1000] OF INT;
   END_TYPE

The maximum total array size is limited to prevent memory allocation issues and ensure reasonable compilation performance.
