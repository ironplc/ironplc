.. problem-summary:: P4021

This error occurs when an EXIT statement appears outside of a loop. EXIT is only valid inside FOR, WHILE, or REPEAT loops, where it terminates the innermost enclosing loop.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P4021:

.. code-block::

   PROGRAM main
   VAR
       x : INT;
   END_VAR
       x := 1;
       EXIT;  (* Error: not inside a loop *)
   END_PROGRAM

The EXIT statement is in the program body but not inside any loop.

To fix this error, move the EXIT statement inside a loop or remove it:

.. code-block::

   PROGRAM main
   VAR
       x : INT;
   END_VAR
       FOR x := 1 TO 10 BY 1 DO
           IF x = 5 THEN
               EXIT;  (* Valid: inside a FOR loop *)
           END_IF;
       END_FOR;
   END_PROGRAM
