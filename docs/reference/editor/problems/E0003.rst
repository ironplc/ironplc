.. problem-summary:: E0003

The IronPLC compiler failed to disassemble an :file:`.iplc` bytecode file.

When you open an :file:`.iplc` file, the VS Code extension asks the compiler to disassemble
the binary contents so they can be displayed in a human-readable form. This error means the
compiler was found and running, but the disassembly request failed.

Common causes include:

- The file is corrupted or truncated
- The file was created by an incompatible compiler version
- The file is not a valid IPLC bytecode file despite having the :file:`.iplc` extension

**Solutions**:

1. **Check the file**: Ensure the file is a valid IPLC bytecode file produced by
   the IronPLC compiler.

2. **Recompile**: If the file was produced by an older compiler version, recompile
   the source to produce an updated bytecode file.

3. **Check for corruption**: If the file was transferred over a network or extracted
   from an archive, verify it was not corrupted during transfer.

4. **Report the issue**: If the file should be valid, open an issue on
   `GitHub <https://github.com/ironplc/ironplc/issues>`_ with the error details
   shown in the message.
