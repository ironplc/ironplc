IronPLC is the beginning of a development environment for IEC 61131-3. IronPLC
integrates into Visual Studio Code and provides tools to work with files:

* auto-completion
* syntax and semantic checks

IronPLC aims to be a SoftPLC written entirely in safe Rust for embedded devices
running programs written in the IEC 61131-3 language, but it isn't there yet.
IronPLC has some pretty big limitations and is not going to replace your
existing development environment any time soon. Even so, I'd love if you give
it a try, let me know what you think, fix a bug, or even become a regular
contributor.

For now, follow the steps in the :doc:`quickstart/index` guide to get started.
