The program :program:`ironplcc` (:program:`ironplcc.exe` on Windows) is IronPLCâ€™s
command line interface. Most developers will use :program:`ironplcc` through the
Visual Studio Code Extension, but you can also use :program:`ironplcc` directly,
for example, to implement a continuous integration pipeline.

This chapter describes how to use the command line interface.
