.. problem-summary:: P0004

This error occurs when a subrange declaration has a minimum value that is not strictly less than the maximum value.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P0004:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       INVALID_RANGE : INT(10..-10);  (* Error: minimum (10) >= maximum (-10) *)
   END_TYPE

The subrange declaration has a minimum value of 10 and maximum value of -10, but the minimum must be strictly less than the maximum.

To fix this error, ensure the minimum value is less than the maximum value:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       VALID_RANGE : INT(-10..10);  (* Correct: minimum (-10) < maximum (10) *)
   END_TYPE
