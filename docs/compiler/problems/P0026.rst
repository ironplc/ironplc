.. problem-summary:: P0026

This error occurs when the compiler is unable to read a source file from disk.

Example
-------

This error typically occurs when:

1. The specified file does not exist
2. You don't have permission to read the file
3. The file is locked by another process
4. There are hardware or filesystem issues

.. code-block:: bash

   # Examples that would cause this error:
   ironplcc check nonexistent_file.st             # File doesn't exist
   ironplcc check /root/private_file.st           # Permission denied
   ironplcc check locked_file.st                  # File locked by another process

To fix this error, ensure that:

- The file exists at the specified path
- You have read permissions for the file
- The file is not locked by another application
- The filesystem and storage device are functioning correctly

.. code-block::

   (* Example of a valid file that can be read *)
   FUNCTION_BLOCK ReadableFile
   VAR_INPUT
       InputSignal : BOOL;
   END_VAR
   VAR_OUTPUT
       OutputSignal : BOOL;
   END_VAR
   
   OutputSignal := InputSignal;
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
