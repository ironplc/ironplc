.. problem-summary:: P0010

This error occurs when there is a recursive cycle in the library declarations, where items reference each other in a circular manner.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P0010:

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK SelfRecursive
   VAR
       SelfRecursiveInstance : SelfRecursive;  (* Error: Self-reference creates cycle *)
   END_VAR
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

The function block ``SelfRecursive`` contains an instance of itself, creating a recursive cycle that cannot be resolved.

To fix this error, break the cycle by using a different approach:

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK Callee
   VAR
       Input1: BOOL;
   END_VAR
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

   FUNCTION_BLOCK Caller
   VAR
       CalleeInstance : Callee;  (* Correct: No self-reference *)
   END_VAR
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
