.. problem-summary:: P2007

This error occurs when a type declaration name is duplicated within the same scope.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P2007:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       the_struct : STRUCT
           member: BOOL;
       END_STRUCT;  
       the_struct : STRUCT  (* Error: Duplicate type name *)
           member: BOOL;
       END_STRUCT; 
   END_TYPE

The type ``the_struct`` is declared twice within the same ``TYPE`` block, which is not allowed.

To fix this error, ensure all type names are unique within their scope:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       the_struct : STRUCT
           member: BOOL;
       END_STRUCT;  
       another_struct : STRUCT  (* Correct: Different name *)
           member: BOOL;
       END_STRUCT; 
   END_TYPE
