.. problem-summary:: P0025

This error occurs when the compiler is unable to read a directory, typically when trying to initialize a project from a directory path.

Example
-------

This error typically occurs when:

1. The specified directory does not exist
2. You don't have permission to read the directory
3. The path points to a file instead of a directory
4. The directory is corrupted or inaccessible

.. code-block:: bash

   # Examples that would cause this error:
   ironplcc check /nonexistent/directory/          # Directory doesn't exist
   ironplcc check /root/private/                   # Permission denied
   ironplcc check /path/to/file.st                 # Path is a file, not directory

To fix this error, ensure that:

- The directory path exists
- You have read permissions for the directory
- The path actually points to a directory, not a file
- The filesystem is functioning correctly
