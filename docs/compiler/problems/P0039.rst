.. problem-summary:: P0039

This error occurs when a type alias references a parent type that has not been declared.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P0039:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       TypeAlias : UndeclaredType;  (* Error: UndeclaredType is not declared *)
   END_TYPE

The type alias ``TypeAlias`` references ``UndeclaredType`` which has not been declared.

To fix this error, declare the parent type before creating the alias:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       ParentType : INT;
       TypeAlias : ParentType;  (* Correct: ParentType is now declared *)
   END_TYPE

Alternatively, use a built-in type:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       TypeAlias : INT;  (* Correct: INT is a built-in type *)
   END_TYPE
