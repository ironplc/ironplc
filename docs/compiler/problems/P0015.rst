.. problem-summary:: P0015

This error occurs when a variable is referenced but not declared in the current scope.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P0015:

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK LOGGER
   VAR
       TRIG0 : BOOL;
   END_VAR
   
   TRIG := TRIG0;  (* Error: TRIG is not declared *)
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

The variable ``TRIG`` is used in the assignment but is not declared in the ``VAR`` section of the function block.

To fix this error, declare the variable in the appropriate variable section:

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK LOGGER
   VAR
       TRIG : BOOL;   (* Declare the variable *)
       TRIG0 : BOOL;
   END_VAR
   
   TRIG := TRIG0;  (* Correct: TRIG is now declared *)
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
