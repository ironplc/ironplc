.. problem-summary:: P0029

The referenced type is declared by the IEC 61131-3 specification, however this
compiler does not provide an implementation.

This error occurs when a standard library type is used that is not yet implemented in this compiler.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P0029:

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK DUMMY
   VAR_INPUT
       name : TON;  (* Error: TON type not implemented *)
   END_VAR
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

The ``TON`` (Timer On Delay) type is part of the IEC 61131-3 standard library but is not yet implemented in this compiler.

To fix this error, use an alternative approach or wait for the type to be implemented:

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK DUMMY
   VAR_INPUT
       name : BOOL;  (* Use a basic type instead *)
   END_VAR
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
