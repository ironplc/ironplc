.. problem-summary:: P0027

This error occurs when the compiler encounters a symbolic link (symlink) in the file path. The compiler does not support symbolic links for security and consistency reasons.

Example
-------

This error occurs when trying to compile a file that is accessed through a symbolic link:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Create a symbolic link to a Structured Text file
   ln -s /path/to/actual/program.st /path/to/link.st
   
   # This will generate error P0027:
   ironplcc check /path/to/link.st

The compiler encounters the symbolic link ``link.st`` and cannot process it because symbolic links are not supported.

To fix this error, use the actual file path instead of the symbolic link:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Use the actual file path instead
   ironplcc check /path/to/actual/program.st

Alternatively, you can copy the file to a new location without using symbolic links:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Copy the file instead of linking
   cp /path/to/actual/program.st /path/to/program_copy.st
   ironplcc check /path/to/program_copy.st
