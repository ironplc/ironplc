.. problem-summary:: P6001

This error occurs when the compiler is unable to canonicalize a file path, typically due to invalid path components, permission issues, or filesystem problems.

Example
-------

This error typically occurs when:

1. The path contains invalid characters for the filesystem
2. The path references non-existent parent directories
3. There are permission issues accessing the path
4. The filesystem is corrupted or inaccessible

To fix this error, ensure that:

- The file path is valid for your operating system
- All parent directories exist and are accessible
- You have appropriate permissions to access the path
- The filesystem is functioning correctly

.. code-block:: bash

   # Example of problematic paths that might cause this error:
   ironplcc check "/invalid\0path/file.st"        # Invalid null character
   ironplcc check "//server/missing/file.st"      # Non-existent network path
   ironplcc check "/root/restricted/file.st"      # Permission denied
