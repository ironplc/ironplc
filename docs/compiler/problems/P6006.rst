.. problem-summary:: P6006

This error occurs when a source file is not encoded with a supported character encoding. IEC 61131-3 files must be encoded with an ISO/IEC 10646-1 compatible character set (such as UTF-8 or Windows-1252).

Example
-------

This error typically occurs when:

1. The file is a binary file (not a text file)
2. The file uses an unsupported text encoding
3. The file contains invalid or corrupted character data

.. code-block:: bash

   # Examples that would cause this error:
   ironplcc check binary_file.st                  # Binary file, not text
   ironplcc check file_with_invalid_encoding.st   # Unsupported encoding

To fix this error, ensure that your source files are:

- Saved as text files (not binary)
- Encoded in UTF-8 (recommended) or Windows-1252
- Free of corrupted character data

.. code-block:: bash

   # Convert file to UTF-8 encoding (Linux/macOS)
   iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 input.st > output.st
   
   # Or save the file with UTF-8 encoding in your text editor

Example of a properly encoded Structured Text file:

.. code-block::

   (* This file should be saved with UTF-8 encoding *)
   FUNCTION_BLOCK ValidEncoding
   VAR_INPUT
       InputData : BOOL;
   END_VAR
   VAR_OUTPUT
       OutputData : BOOL;
   END_VAR
   
   OutputData := InputData;
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
