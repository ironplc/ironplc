.. problem-summary:: P0033

This error occurs when a POU (Program Organization Unit) declaration name is duplicated within the same scope.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P0033:

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK MyFunction
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

   FUNCTION_BLOCK MyFunction  (* Error: Duplicate POU name *)
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

The function block ``MyFunction`` is declared twice, which is not allowed.

To fix this error, ensure all POU names are unique within their scope:

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK MyFunction1
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

   FUNCTION_BLOCK MyFunction2  (* Correct: Different name *)
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
