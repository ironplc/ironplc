.. problem-summary:: P0003

This error occurs when a structure type declaration has duplicate element names.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P0003:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       CustomStruct : STRUCT
           Name: BOOL;
           Name: BOOL;  (* Error: Duplicate element name *)
       END_STRUCT;
   END_TYPE

The structure has two elements with the same name ``Name``, which is not allowed.

To fix this error, ensure all element names in a structure are unique:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       CustomStruct : STRUCT
           Name1: BOOL;
           Name2: BOOL;  (* Different name *)
       END_STRUCT;
   END_TYPE
