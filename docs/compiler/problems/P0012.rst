.. problem-summary:: P0012

This error occurs when a type is referenced as an enumeration but is not declared as an enumeration type.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P0012:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       MyStruct : STRUCT
           field1: BOOL;
       END_STRUCT;
   END_TYPE

   FUNCTION_BLOCK Example
   VAR_INPUT
       level : MyStruct := CRITICAL;  (* Error: MyStruct is not an enumeration *)
   END_VAR
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

The variable ``level`` is assigned an enumeration value ``CRITICAL``, but ``MyStruct`` is declared as a structure, not an enumeration.

To fix this error, use the correct enumeration type:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       LOGLEVEL : (CRITICAL, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG) := INFO;
   END_TYPE

   FUNCTION_BLOCK Example
   VAR_INPUT
       level : LOGLEVEL := CRITICAL;  (* Correct: LOGLEVEL is an enumeration *)
   END_VAR
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
