.. problem-summary:: P0032

This error occurs when C-style comments (``//``) are used in the code, which are not allowed in IEC 61131-3.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P0032:

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK Example
   VAR
       Counter : INT;
   END_VAR
   
   // This is a C-style comment  (* Error: C-style comments not allowed *)
   Counter := Counter + 1;
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

The code uses ``//`` for comments, which is C-style syntax and not valid in IEC 61131-3.

To fix this error, you have two options:

**Option 1: Use proper IEC 61131-3 comment syntax**

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK Example
   VAR
       Counter : INT;
   END_VAR
   
   (* This is a proper IEC 61131-3 comment *)
   Counter := Counter + 1;
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

**Option 2: Enable C-style comments with command line option**

If you prefer to use C-style comments, you can enable them with the ``--allow-c-style-comments`` command line option when running the compiler.
