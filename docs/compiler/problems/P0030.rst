.. problem-summary:: P0030

This error occurs when the set of valid source files has no content, meaning no valid Structured Text code was provided for compilation.

Example
-------

This error typically occurs when:

1. No source files are provided to the compiler
2. All provided source files are empty
3. All provided source files contain only comments or whitespace

To fix this error, ensure that at least one source file contains valid Structured Text code:

.. code-block::

   (* This is a valid Structured Text program *)
   FUNCTION_BLOCK Example
   VAR_INPUT
       Input1 : BOOL;
   END_VAR
   VAR_OUTPUT
       Output1 : BOOL;
   END_VAR
   
   Output1 := Input1;
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
