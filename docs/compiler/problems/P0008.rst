.. problem-summary:: P0008

This error occurs when a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) body in a PLCopen XML file does not define an initial step. Every SFC must have exactly one step marked as the initial step where execution begins.

Example
-------

The following XML defines an SFC body without an initial step:

.. code-block:: xml

   <pou name="MyProgram" pouType="program">
     <body>
       <SFC>
         <step name="Step1">
           <!-- Missing initialStep="true" attribute -->
         </step>
         <step name="Step2"/>
       </SFC>
     </body>
   </pou>

The SFC body contains steps but none of them are marked as the initial step.

To fix this error, add the ``initialStep="true"`` attribute to exactly one step:

.. code-block:: xml

   <pou name="MyProgram" pouType="program">
     <body>
       <SFC>
         <step name="Step1" initialStep="true">
           <!-- This step is now the initial step -->
         </step>
         <step name="Step2"/>
       </SFC>
     </body>
   </pou>

According to the IEC 61131-3 standard, every SFC network must have exactly one initial step, which defines where execution starts when the SFC is activated.
