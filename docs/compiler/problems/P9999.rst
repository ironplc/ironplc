.. problem-summary:: P9999

Analyzing the IEC 61131-3 source failed because the source contains elements
that are not supported by this compiler. The elements are probably valid.

Because the compiler does not support the elements, the solution normally
requires adding support for the elements to the IronPLC compiler.

* avoid the particular elements (this is usually not feasible)
* verify that you have the latest version of the IronPLC compiler
* report the issue to `IronPLC GitHub issues`_.
