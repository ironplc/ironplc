.. problem-summary:: P4019

This error occurs when a resource declaration contains two or more tasks with the same name. Each task within a resource must have a unique name.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P4019:

.. code-block::

   CONFIGURATION config
       RESOURCE resource1 ON PLC
           TASK my_task(INTERVAL := T#100ms, PRIORITY := 1);
           TASK my_task(INTERVAL := T#200ms, PRIORITY := 2);  (* Error: Duplicate task name *)
           PROGRAM instance1 WITH my_task : my_prg;
       END_RESOURCE
   END_CONFIGURATION

The code defines two tasks with the same name ``my_task`` within the same resource, which is not allowed.

To fix this error, give each task a unique name:

.. code-block::

   CONFIGURATION config
       RESOURCE resource1 ON PLC
           TASK fast_task(INTERVAL := T#100ms, PRIORITY := 1);
           TASK slow_task(INTERVAL := T#200ms, PRIORITY := 2);
           PROGRAM instance1 WITH fast_task : my_prg;
       END_RESOURCE
   END_CONFIGURATION
