.. problem-summary:: P2025

This error occurs when a type is referenced that is not found in the type environment. The type environment contains all types that have been successfully resolved, including built-in types and user-declared types.

This differs from P2008, which occurs earlier in the compilation pipeline when resolving late-bound type initializers. P2025 occurs when validating type usage against the resolved type environment.

Example
-------

The following code will generate error P2025:

.. code-block::

   FUNCTION_BLOCK Example
   VAR
       MyVar : UndeclaredType;
   END_VAR
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

The variable ``MyVar`` uses the type ``UndeclaredType`` which is not present in the type environment because it was never declared.

To fix this error, declare the type before using it:

.. code-block::

   TYPE
       MyType : INT;
   END_TYPE

   FUNCTION_BLOCK Example
   VAR
       MyVar : MyType;
   END_VAR
   END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
