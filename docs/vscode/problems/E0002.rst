.. problem-summary:: E0002

The IPLC Bytecode Viewer could not find the IronPLC compiler when opening an :file:`.iplc` file.

When you open an :file:`.iplc` bytecode file, the VS Code extension uses the IronPLC compiler
to disassemble the binary contents. If the compiler has not started within a few seconds of
opening the file, the viewer displays this error.

This is similar to :doc:`E0001`, but occurs specifically in the bytecode viewer rather than
during general extension activation.

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify installation**: Open a terminal and run :program:`ironplcc --version`. If this
   fails, the compiler is not installed or not in your PATH.

2. **Install the compiler**: See the :doc:`/quickstart/installation` guide.

3. **Configure the path manually**: If the compiler is installed in a non-standard
   location, set the ``ironplc.path`` setting to the full path of the executable.

4. **Reload the window**: If the compiler was recently installed, run
   "Developer: Reload Window" from the Command Palette to restart the extension.
