The IronPLC Visual Studio Code Extension failed to locate the IronPLC Compiler.

The extension cannot find the :program:`ironplcc` executable. The extension searches
these locations in order:

1. **Configuration**: The path specified in ``ironplc.path`` setting
2. **Environment variable**: The ``IRONPLC`` environment variable
3. **Homebrew** (macOS only): ``/opt/homebrew/bin/ironplcc``
4. **Windows AppData**: ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\IronPLC Compiler\bin\ironplcc.exe``

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify installation**: Open a terminal and run :program:`ironplcc --version`. If this
   fails, the compiler is not installed or not in your PATH.

2. **Install the compiler**: See the :doc:`/quickstart/installation` guide.

3. **Configure the path manually**: If the compiler is installed in a non-standard
   location, set the ``ironplc.path`` setting to the full path of the executable.

4. **Check permissions**: Ensure the compiler executable has execute permissions.
