# Defines a weekly build for the project. Each week (or when triggered)
# create a new release (having a new release number).
#
# The essential strategy is:
#    1. Determine the next semantic version number
#    2. Update the code, create a commit with the version number, create a
#       Github release
#    3. Build the artifacts using the tag as the starting point
#    4. Check that everything actually works together
#    5. Publish the changes
#    6. clean up old artifacts
