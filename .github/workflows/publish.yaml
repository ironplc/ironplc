# Defines a weekly build for the project. Each week (or a trigger)
# releases a new version, incrementing the current version number.
#
# The essential strategy is:
#    1. Determine the next semantic version number
#    2. Update the code, create a commit with the version number, create a
#       Github release
#    3. Build the artifacts using the tag as the starting point
#    4. Cleanup Github release

  # Automatically create a release every Monday at 19:00
